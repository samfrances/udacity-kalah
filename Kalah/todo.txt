TESTING TODO:

- Thoroughly test gameplay
- Thoroughly test Game.move

OTHER TODO:

Update README to reflect new game cancellation endpoint
Update GameForm to reflect whether game is canceled or not
Consider updating get_game endpoint to change message of gameform if game inactive
Update make_move endpoint so it doesn't work with cancelled games

COMPLETED TESTING:

- Test that cancel_game endpoint does result in cancelation
- Check that you cannot cancel a game that has been completed
- Check that Game.active computed field updates when game is completed or canceled
- Check that User.get_games returns only active games
- Check that User.get_games can return all games when active_only parameter is False
